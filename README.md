## Background

This study examines why the architectural precision of the Great Pyramid, achieved without mortar, declined within a century. By using archaeoastronomical modelling and palaeohydrological reconstruction, the paper challenges the conventional dating of the Giza complex (c. 2500 BCE). It proposes that its orientation to Orion’s Belt and dock access patterns match better with a construction window around **4400 ± 200 BCE**.
