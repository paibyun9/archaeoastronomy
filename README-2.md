## 📚 Background

This study investigates why the architectural precision of the Great Pyramid—achieved without mortar—declined drastically within a century.  
Using archaeoastronomical modelling and palaeohydrological reconstruction, the paper challenges the conventional construction date of the Giza complex (c. 2500 BCE).  
Instead, it proposes that both the Orion alignment and harbour access patterns align more precisely with a construction window around **4400 ± 200 BCE**.
