# Appendix A. Statistical Results for S-Value Thresholding

To validate the S-value classification scheme, we conducted 10,000 iterations of Monte Carlo simulations under randomized azimuth vectors. The objective was to test the probability of obtaining S-values below the threshold for strong alignment (S < 0.02) by chance.

## Results Summary
- **Simulations run**: 10,000  
- **Observed frequency (S < 0.02)**: 73 out of 10,000  
- **Estimated p-value**: 0.0073 (i.e., < 0.01)  

## Threshold Classification
- **Strong alignment**: S < 0.02  
- **Moderate alignment**: 0.02 ≤ S < 0.1  
- **Weak/no alignment**: S ≥ 0.1  

## Observed S-values (Example)

| Structure             | Epoch (BCE) | Observed S-value |
|-----------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Great Pyramid (Khufu) | 4400        | 0.0138           |
| Sphinx                | 4400        | 0.0154           |
| Khafre Valley Temple  | 4400        | 0.0172           |

> **Note:** The observed S-value of **0.0138** for the Great Pyramid reflects its **individual azimuthal deviation** from Alnitak’s heliacal rising point in **4400 ± 200 BCE**.  
> By contrast, the **S = 0.006** reported in **Figure 2** represents a **Monte Carlo–optimised best-fit alignment** calculated across **multiple monuments**—including the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx, and the Khafre Valley Temple—modelled as a collective group.  
> Both values fall within the **“strong alignment” threshold (S < 0.02)**, reinforcing the hypothesis of intentional orientation toward Orion’s Belt during the mid-Holocene.
